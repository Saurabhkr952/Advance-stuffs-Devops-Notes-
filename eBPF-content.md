That sounds exciting! eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful technology for running sandboxed programs in the Linux kernel without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules. Here’s a quick study plan you can follow over the next four days:

### Day 1: Introduction to eBPF
- **Concepts**: Understand what eBPF is and its purpose. Read about its architecture and how it differs from traditional packet filtering.
- **Resources**:
  - Official eBPF website
  - Introductory articles or tutorials (e.g., "What is eBPF?" on Medium)
- **Hands-on**: Install eBPF tooling on your machine (e.g., BPF Compiler Collection (BCC), bpftrace).

### Day 2: eBPF Programs and Use Cases
- **Types of Programs**: Learn about different types of eBPF programs (e.g., XDP, TC, tracepoints).
- **Use Cases**: Explore common use cases like performance monitoring, networking, and security.
- **Resources**:
  - “Linux BPF: A New Approach to Networking and Security” (Google’s eBPF resources)
  - Case studies of eBPF in production (Cilium, Falco).
- **Hands-on**: Write a simple eBPF program (e.g., a basic network packet filter).

### Day 3: Tools and Frameworks
- **Tools**: Familiarize yourself with popular tools like bpftrace and Cilium.
- **Exploration**: Look into how these tools utilize eBPF for monitoring and networking.
- **Resources**:
  - bpftrace documentation
  - Cilium documentation
- **Hands-on**: Experiment with bpftrace to gather metrics on system calls or network events.

### Day 4: Advanced Topics and Best Practices
- **Advanced Concepts**: Learn about maps, helper functions, and the eBPF verifier.
- **Performance Tuning**: Understand performance implications and best practices for writing efficient eBPF programs.
- **Resources**:
  - “BPF Performance Tools” by Brendan Gregg (if you can access it)
  - eBPF community discussions on GitHub and forums.
- **Hands-on**: Optimize a previously written program or explore a more complex example.

### Final Tips
- **Documentation**: Keep the official eBPF documentation handy.
- **Join Communities**: Engage with eBPF communities on platforms like GitHub, Slack, or Discord for support.
- **Take Notes**: Document what you learn each day to reinforce your understanding.
