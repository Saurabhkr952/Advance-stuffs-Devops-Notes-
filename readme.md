### USE configmap and secrets as as volumemount and use `readOnly: true` to only read from volumes. 
### and if you use configmap as env variable use `immutable: true` to protects you from accidental (or unwanted) updates that could cause applications outages.


### secret rotation - big company use to do it. to make more secure their sensitive information to make it more secure. withing 15-30 days
### best use external-secret-operator -----> for store kubernetes secrets.l


### Aws graviton 
[AWS GRAVITON](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/engineering-teams-should-embrace-graviton4)

### tweak loadbalancer based on latency, input or output, based on topology( geo location) ---> advance project

###  When the ingress controller gets configured. It creates a layer 4 loadbalancer in the cloud. We need to add the loadbalancer ip address in the domain registrar website to map the domain name and add 'A record'.
- Every ingress controller only handle layer 7 traffic.
- Learn about gateway api ---> futureee


### Cert manager enable https
- Download ca files
- Create proxy from clusterissuer/issuer
- Create certificate request which hits then it signed from the server and then it stored on the secret. 
- Then we have to modify the ingress file to add the secret.
