###  Four golden signals in measuring the systemâ€™s performance and reliability.

  **latency**
  - Latency measures how long it takes a particular part of a system to return a result.
    (Sample latency metrics include page load latency, number of requests waiting for a thread, query duration, service response time, transaction duration, time to first response, time to complete data return.)

  **traffic** 
  - measures how many requests are reaching your system.
    (its historical trends are used for capacity planning, core measure when you calculate infrastructure spend)
  - (number of transactions per second, number of retrievals per second, number of active   
    requests, number of write iops, number of read iops and number active connections.)  

  **saturation**
  - it is indicator of current system demands. In other words, how full the service is.
  - (Sample capacity metrics include, percentage of memory utilization, percentage of thread    pool utilization, percentage of cache utilization, percentage of disk utilization, percentage of CPU utilization, Disk quota, Memory quota, number of available connections and number of users on the system)

  **errors**
  - indicate configuration or capacity issues.
  - time to send alerts 
  - Sample error metrics include wrong answers or incorrect content, number of 400/500 HTTP codes, number of failed requests, number of exceptions, number of stack traces, servers that fail liveness checks and number of dropped connections.
