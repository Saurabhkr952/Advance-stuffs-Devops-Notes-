# Site Reliability Engineering

- SRE is both role & practice.
- Not every organization that follows SRE principles necessarily must have engineers with the title SRE.
- focus on practices & principles.
- The goal of SRE is to serve the business and the user, not the other way round.
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is the practice of balancing the velocity of development features with the risk to reliability.
- SRE is a practical way to implement DevOps philosophy.

### Let me explain where these fundamentals fit into the key areas of DevOps we discussed.

1. **Reduced owner silos(Share ownsership)** - SREs share ownership of production with developers. they define service level objectives(SLOs) and error budgets, and share responsibility of how they determine reliability and prioritize work.

2. **accept failure as normal (Blamelessness)** - A blameless postmortem is held after an incident to improve the understanding of the failure mode and to identify effective preventive actions to reduce the likelihood or impact of a similar incident. Learning from incidents in this matter requires a culture of psychological safety and blamelessness.

3. **Implement gradual change(Reduce Risk of failure)** - SREs aim to reduce the cost of failure by rolling out changes to a small percentage of users before making them generally available. This promotes design thinking & Prototyping. 

4. **Leveraging tool & automation (Toil Automation)** 
5. **Measure Everything(Measure Toil & Realibility & Health of the systems)** 


### The mission of SRE 
- To protect, provide for, and progress software and systems with consistent focus on availability, latency, performance, and capacity.


**SLA:** The **agreement** you make with your clients or users.

**SLOs:** The **objectives** your team must hit to meet that agreement.

**SLI:** The real numbers onyour performance.

**TOIL:** Automation

**Error budget:** The amount of unreliability you are willing to tolerate.
